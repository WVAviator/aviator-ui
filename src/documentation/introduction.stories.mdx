# AviatorUI

AviatorUI is a simple, yet powerful, headless React component library. Benefit
from fully-featured, accesible, and robust React components without being locked
into the styling that other UI libraries force upon you.

To get started, install the npm package:

```
npm install aviator-ui
```

or, if you're using Yarn:

```
yarn add aviator-ui
```

...and that's it - you're ready to go! Out of the box, you can start adding
components to your app, and they'll render in the browser with the default
styles. If you want to customize those styles, you can simply use the className
prop on the components, just as you would for any other React component, and
your styles will override the defaults.

```
<>
    <Button>Default Styles</Button>
    <Button className="custom-btn">Custom Styles</Button>
</>
```
```
.custom-btn {
    background-color: #f00;
    color: #fff;
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    border: none;
}
```

<div style={{display: "flex", gap: "2rem", alignItems: "center"}}><Button>Default Styles</Button>
<Button style={{backgroundColor: "#f00", color: "#FFF", fontSize: "1.5rem", border: "none"}}>Custom Styles</Button></div>

This library will work with vanilla CSS, CSS modules, TailwindCSS, CSS-in-JS, or
any other CSS framework you choose to use. Any styles you apply will
automatically override the default AviatorUI styles.

If you want to apply styling across all components, you can use the included
Theme and ThemeProvider. Define your own custom Theme using the included
createTheme() function...

```
const theme = createTheme({
        colors: {
            primary: '#00ff99',
            secondary: '#ff0099',
        },
    },
});
```

...and pass the result to a ThemeProvider component that wraps your app.

```
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
	<React.StrictMode>
        <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
		    <App />
        </ThemeProvider>
	</React.StrictMode>
);
```

Any properties of the Theme object you define will override those properties on
the default theme. For more information on which properties are available, see
the Theme section of the documentation.
